Conclusion :
Based on the initial purpose with this analysis we helped the Superstore identify:
Technology and Home Office have on average a high profit margin, while Furniture are being sold at low margin or even at a loss for some its sub-categories.
The Consumer segment is driving most of the Superstore's sales and across all segments Technology is contributing the most to revenue.
Over 50% of their profit is being made in California and New York. This makes this store quite geographically dependent on keeping up their sales here.
Their sales in Texas (which is their 3rd highest state in sales) is on aggregate making a loss.
